    <h1 style="text-align: center;">CHICKEN JOY</h1>
    
<ul>

INGREDIENTS:
<li>Chicken: we are using drumsticks for this recipe. Feel free to use bone in thighs or chicken wings.</li> 
<li>Flour: this recipe uses All Purpose Flour.</li>
<li>Cornstarch: cornstarch is often used in Asian fried chicken recipes. It's a must for extra crispy result.</li>
<li>Garlic Powder and Five Spice Powder: must haves! You can find Five Spice Powder at asian store.</li>
<li>Milk: regular milk works fine for this recipe. I am using 2% milk.</li>
<li>Egg: 1 large egg, this serves as the binder.</li>
<li>Salt and Black Pepper: to marinade chicken.</li>
<li>Oil: Vegetable oil or Canola oil works fine. For deep-frying chicken joy.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    INSTRUCTIONS:
<li>Season chicken with salt and black pepper to taste. Let it sit for 2-3 hours to marinate.</li>
<li>To make the Flour mixture. In a bowl mix flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, five spice powder and salt. Stir until well combined. In a separate bowl, combine egg and milk.</li>
<li>To assemble the chicken. Toss chicken to flour mixture until well coated. Transfer and dip chicken to egg mixture then back to flour mixture.</li>
<li>Fry Chicken. In over medium heat deep pan or pot. Add 4 cups of oil. Deep fry chicken for 15 minutes turning each piece halfway, until chicken is golden brown and cooked through.</li>
</li>Remove from the oil and drain excess oil. Let them rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
