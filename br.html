<ul>
INGREDIENTS:
<li>1 lb. sirloin, thinly sliced against the grain into bite-size strips</li>
<li>6 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped</li>
<li>⅓ cup (packed) light brown sugar</li>
<li>¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. distilled white vinegar</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. cornstarch</li>
<li>½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>¼ tsp. kosher salt</li>
<li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>4 cups chilled leftover cooked jasmine rice</li>
<li>1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more</li>
<li>¼ cup (or more) vegetable oil</li>
<li>12 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 large eggs</li>

</ul>

<ol type="1">
    INSTRUCTIONS:
<li>Pat beef dry with paper towels. Whisk garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, cornstarch, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt in a medium bowl. Add beef to marinade and toss well to coat. Cover and chill at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over high. Drain beef in a sieve, letting as much excess marinade drip off as possible. Add half of beef to skillet, arranging in a single layer and cook, turning halfway through, until beef is cooked through and deeply browned in spots, about 3 minutes (be careful; the marinade will splatter). Transfer beef to a plate. Discard any garlic remaining in pan and repeat process with remaining beef. Keep warm. Clean skillet and set aside.</li>
<li>Place rice in a large bowl and break up with a rubber spatula. Stir in 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt; set aside.</li>
<li>Heat oil in reserved skillet over medium-low. Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain garlic in a fine-mesh sieve set over a small bowl; transfer to a small plate.</li>
<li>Pour 2 Tbsp. garlic oil back into skillet and heat over medium-high. Add reserved rice mixture and stir to coat in oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Set 1 Tbsp. fried garlic aside for serving and stir remaining fried garlic into rice. Transfer to a bowl and keep warm.</li>
<li>Heat remaining garlic oil in the same skillet over medium-high (you should have 2 Tbsp.; add vegetable oil to make up the difference if needed). Crack eggs into skillet and season with salt. Cook until whites are almost set, about 2 minutes. Carefully tilt skillet so oil pools on one side. Spoon oil over egg whites until fully set, about 1 minute.</li>
<li>Divide rice mixture, meat, and eggs among plates and top with reserved fried garlic.</li>
